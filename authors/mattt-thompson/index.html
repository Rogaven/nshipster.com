          <p>2014 was an incredible year professionally for Apple developers. With a deluge of new developments—both from Cupertino and the community at large—there were no shortage of interesting tidbits for readers to share.</p>

        </li>

          <p>For many of us, the simplicity, elegance, and performance of Apple&rsquo;s hardware and software working together are the reason why we build on their platforms. And yet, after just a few months of working with Swift, Cocoa has begun to lose its luster.</p>

        </li>

          <p>After taking a look at WatchKit, there were a few things that jumped out coming from UIKit. They&rsquo;re the kind of subjective, opinionated things that don&rsquo;t make for good documentation, but might be interesting or useful to anyone else as they&rsquo;re getting started.</p>

        </li>

          <p>In many ways, the story of Apple has been about fusing together technologies through happy accidents of history to create something better than before: OS X as a hybrid of MacOS &amp; NeXTSTEP. Objective-C as the combination of Smalltalk&rsquo;s OOP paradigm and C. iCloud as the byproduct of MobileMe and actual clouds (presumably).</p>

          <p>C uses preprocessor directives capable of unspeakable evil. Swift has a safe subset of preprocessor directives. So how do we check system version for API compatibility?</p>

          <p>Did you know that <code>UIAlertView</code> and <code>UIActionSheet</code> (as well as their respective delegate protocols) are deprecated in iOS 8? It&rsquo;s true.</p>

          <p>Objective-C required us to wax philosophic about the nature of equality and identity. To the relief of any developer less inclined towards handwavy treatises, this is not as much the case for Swift.</p>

          <p>Yesterday&rsquo;s article described various techniques for resizing images using APIs from the UIKit, Core Graphics, Core Image, and Image I/O frameworks. However, that article failed to mention some rather extraordinary functionality baked into the new Photos framework which takes care of all of this for you.</p>

          <p>Since time immemorial, iOS developers have been perplexed by a singular question: &lsquo;How do you resize an image?&rsquo;. This article endeavors to provide a clear answer to this eternal question.</p>

          <p>Swift enumerations are a marked improvement over the <code>NS_ENUM</code> macro in Objective-C. Unfortunately, <code>NS_OPTIONS</code> does not compare as favorably.</p>

          <p>Protocols are the foundation of generics in Swift, but suffer from the lack of a built-in way to provide default implementations for methods. However, there is an interesting workaround in Swift that you probably haven&rsquo;t noticed.</p>

          <p>iOS has a complicated relationship with the web. And it goes back to the very inception of the platform nearly a decade ago.</p>

          <p>Last week, we wrote about overloading and creating custom operators in Swift, a language feature that is as powerful as it is controversial. By all accounts, this week&rsquo;s issue threatens to be equally polarizing, as it covers a feature of Swift that is pervasive, yet invisible: literal convertibles.</p>

          <time datetime="2014-08-11T00:00:00-07:00" itemprop="datePublished">August 11<sup>th</sup>, 2014</time>
          <p>Operators in Swift are among the most interesting and indeed controversial features of this new language.</p>

          <p>Although we still have a few months to wait before we can ship apps in Swift, there is already a proliferation of open source projects built with this new language. One such project is Alamofire.</p>

          <p>In life, there&rsquo;s always work to be done. Every day brings with it a steady stream of tasks and chores to fill the working hours of our existence. Productivity is, as in life as it is in programming, a matter of scheduling and prioritizing and multi-tasking work in order to keep up appearances.</p>

          <p>NSHipster.com was launched 2 years ago to the day. Each week since has featured a new article on some obscure topic in Objective-C or Cocoa (with only a couple gaps). Let&rsquo;s celebrate with some cake.</p>

          <p>Diagnostics combine logic with analytics to arrive at a conclusion. It&rsquo;s science and engineering at their purest. It&rsquo;s human reasoning at its most potent. For us developers, our medium of code informs the production of subsequent code, creating a positive feedback loop that has catapulted the development of technology exponentially over the last half century. For us Objective-C developers specifically, the most effective diagnostics come from Clang.</p>

          <p>Ask anyone, and they&rsquo;ll tell you: WWDC 2014 was the one of the most exciting in recent memory. This week, we&rsquo;ll take a look beneath the headline features, and share some of the more obscure APIs that everyone should know about.</p>

          <p>Our second annual WWDC Pub Quiz! With dozens of teams, comprised of developers from all around the world, the competition was fierce. How will you stack up?</p>

          <p>When well thought-out and implemented, infrastructure is a multiplying force that drives growth and development. In the case of Objective-C, CocoaPods has provided a much-needed tool for channeling and organizing open source participation.</p>

          <p>Abstractions are necessary for doing meaningful work, but they come at a cost. By benchmarking, a programmer can uncover the hidden performance characteristics of their code, and use this information to optimize accordingly.</p>

          <p>This fifth incarnation of the NSHipster Quiz took on a distinct North-of-the-Border flavor, as part of the NSNorth conference in Ottawa, Ontario. Think you&rsquo;re up to the challenge, eh?</p>

          <p>In programming, what often begins as a necessary instruction eventually becomes a vestigial cue for humans. For developers just starting with Cocoa &amp; Cocoa Touch, the IBAction, IBOutlet, and IBOutletCollection macros are particularly bewildering examples of this phenomenon</p>

          <p>We knew that the Earth was not flat long before 1492. Early navigators observed the way ships would dip out of view over the horizon many centuries before the Age of Discovery. For many iOS developers, though, a flat MKMapView was a necessary conceit until recently.</p>

          <p>Volumes have been written about persisting data, but when it comes to short-lived, temporary files, there is very little to go on for Objective-C. (Or if there has, perhaps it was poetically ephemeral itself).</p>

          <p>Namespacing is the preeminent bugbear of Objective-C. A cosmetic quirk with global implications, the language&rsquo;s lack of identifier containers remains a source of prodigious quantities of caremad for armchair language critics.</p>

          <p>Method swizzling is the process of changing the implementation of an existing selector. It&rsquo;s a technique made possible by the fact that method invocations in Objective-C can be changed at runtime, by changing how selectors are mapped to underlying functions in a class&rsquo;s dispatch table.</p>

          <p>Associated Objects is a feature of the Objective-C 2.0 runtime, which allows objects to associate arbitrary values for keys at runtime. It&rsquo;s dark juju, to be handled with as much caution as any other function from objc/runtime.h</p>

          <p>Unless you work with MKMapView. on a regular basis, the last you may have heard about the current state of cartography on iOS may not have been under the cheeriest of circumstances.

          <p>Amidst revelations of widespread spying by the NSA, the concept of metadata has taken an unexpected role in the national conversation about government surveillance. What is it?

          <p>iOS development all but requires the use of Xcode. And if we&rsquo;re resigned to use an IDE in our development workflow, we might as well make the most of it, right? So this week on NSHipster, we&rsquo;re going to talk about one of the more powerful yet underused features of Xcode: Code Snippets</p>

          <p>The concept of equality is a central point of debate and inquiry in philosophy and mathematics, with far-reaching implications for matters of ethics, justice, and public policy. It is the task of programmers to reconcile our logical and physical understanding of equality with the semantic domains we model.</p>

          <p>NSSet and NSDictionary, along with NSArray are the workhorse collection classes of Foundation. Unlike other standard libraries, implementation details are hidden from developers, allowing them to write simple code and trust that it will be (reasonably) performant.</p>

          <p>What passes for randomness is merely a hidden chain of causality. Of course, app developers could care less about philosophy—what they want is code. Thus, our goal this week: to clear up all of the lingering questions and misunderstandings about doing random things in Objective-C</p>

          <p>There&rsquo;s an adage among Cocoa developers that Objective-C&rsquo;s verbosity lends its code to being effectively self-documenting.

          <p>Cocoa is the envy of other standard libraries when it comes to querying and arranging information. With NSPredicate, NSSortDescriptor, and an occasional NSFetchRequest, even the most complex data tasks can be reduced into just a few, extremely-understandable lines of code.</p>

          <p>Enumeration is where computation gets interesting. It&rsquo;s one thing to encode logic that&rsquo;s executed once, but applying it across a collection—that&rsquo;s what makes programming so powerful.</p>

          <p>Among the most important architectural decisions made when building an app is how to persist data between launches. The question of how, exactly, to re-create the state of the app from the time it was last opened; of how to describe the object graph in such a way that it can be flawlessly reconstructed next time.</p>

          <p>Once again, encoding our logical universe into the cold, calculating bytecode of computers forces us to deal with these questions one way or another. And as you&rsquo;ll see from our discussion of boolean types in Objective-C and its kin, truth is indeed stranger than fiction.</p>

          <p>Search Kit is a C framework for searching and indexing content in human languages. It supports matching on phrase or partial word, including logical &amp; wildcard operators, and can rank results by relevance.

          <p>Objective-C is a rapidly evolving language, in a way that you just don&rsquo;t see in established programming languages.

Square brackets, ridiculously-long method names, and <code>@</code>&rsquo;s. &ldquo;at&rdquo; sign compiler directives are as central to understanding Objective-C&rsquo;s gestalt as its ancestry and underlying mechanisms. It&rsquo;s the sugary glue that allows Objective-C to be such a powerful, expressive language, and yet still compile all the way down to C.</p>

          <p><code>#pragma</code> declarations are a mark of craftsmanship in Objective-C. Although originally purposed for compiling source code across many different compilers, the modern Xcode-savvy programmer uses #pragma declarations to very different ends.</p>

          <p>UICollectionView single-handedly changes the way we will design and develop iOS apps from here on out. This is not to say that collection views are in any way unknown or obscure. But being an NSHipster isn&rsquo;t just about knowing obscure gems in the rough. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s about knowing about up-and-comers before they become popular and sell out.</p>

          <p>Foundation boasts one of the best, most complete implementations of strings around. But a string implementation is only as good as the programmer who wields it. So this week, we&rsquo;re going to explore some common uses&ndash;and misuses&ndash;of an important part of the Foundation string ecosystem: NSCharacterSet.</p>

          <p>Accessibility, like internationalization, is one of those topics that&rsquo;s difficult to get developers excited about. But as you know, NSHipster is all about getting developers excited about this kind of stuff.</p>

          <p>Internationalization is like flossing: everyone knows they should do it, but probably don&rsquo;t.</p>

          <p>In the pantheon of collection data types in computer science, bag doesn&rsquo;t really have the same clout as lists, sets, associative arrays, trees, graphs, or priority queues. In fact, it&rsquo;s pretty obscure. You&rsquo;ve probably never heard of it.</p>

          <p>Even for a blog dedicated to obscure APIs, <code>NSIncrementalStore</code> sets a new standard. It was introduced in iOS 5, with no more fanfare than the requisite entry in the SDK changelog. Ironically, it is arguably the most important thing to come out of iOS 5, which will completely change the way we build apps from here on out.</p>

          <p>NSString is the crown jewel of Foundation. But as powerful as it is, one would be remiss not to mention its toll-free bridged cousin, CFMutableString—or more specifically, CFStringTransform.</p>

          <p>NSDateComponents serves an important role in Foundation&rsquo;s date and time APIs. By itself, it&rsquo;s nothing impressive—just a container for information about a date (its month, year, day of month, week of year, or whether that month is a leap month). However, combined with NSCalendar, NSDateComponents becomes a remarkably convenient interchange format for calendar calculations.</p>

          <p>Sorting: it&rsquo;s the mainstay of Computer Science 101 exams and whiteboarding interview questions. But when was the last time you actually needed to know how to implement Quicksort yourself?</p>

          <p>Poor NSCache, always being overshadowed by NSMutableDictionary. It&rsquo;s as if no one knew how it provides all of that garbage collection behavior that developers take great pains to re-implement themselves.</p>

          <p>NSIndexSet (like its mutable counterpart, NSMutableIndexSet) is a sorted collection of unique unsigned integers. Think of it like an NSRange that supports non-contiguous series. It has wicked fast operations for finding indexes in ranges or set intersections, and comes with all of the convenience methods you&rsquo;d expect in a Foundation collection class.</p>
